# Regrssion_Model_Analysis
"Regression analysis project predicting delivery time based on distance using linear regression, gradient descent, and exploratory data analysis."
Regression Model Analysis
Project Overview:

This project applies regression techniques to analyze the relationship between independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target). The goal is to demonstrate how regression models can be used to solve real-world business problems and evaluate their performance.

 # Problem Statement:

The project explores how changes in input variables (X) impact an output variable (Y).
Examples include:

Credit Score (X) → Interest Rate (Y)

Age of Employee (X) → Recovery Days (Y)

Distance in km (X) → Delivery Time in hours (Y)

# Tools & Libraries:

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

How to Run


# 1.Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2.Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook Regression_Model_Analysis.ipynb

# Results & Evaluation:

The regression model is evaluated using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score

Visualizations and performance metrics are included in the notebook.

# Future Scope:

Experiment with Ridge/Lasso/Polynomial Regression

Apply cross-validation for better generalization

Add more feature engineering for improved accuracy
